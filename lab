	</div>
	
	<h4>Project description</h4><br>
	<p>FeatureLens is an <em>interface</em> to explore and visualize features in collections of text documents.
	It allows the exploration of frequent patterns found in the text: <br>
	<div class="ena" style="color:saddlebrown;">e.g. frequently used words but also frequent patterns of ngrams which leads to the <em>discovering </em>of fuzzy repetition patterns.</div><br>
	<h3>
		FeatureLens integrates the results of text-miningalgorithms into a meaningful representation of a text collection. Features can be compared, and occurences of the 
		patterns are shown in the text. To help users in <em>finding interesting patterns</em> FeatureLens highlights features that have
		specific patterns of use in the collection (increasing, decreasing, spike behavior etc.</p>
	</h3>
